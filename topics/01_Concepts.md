# Types of Analytics
There are four main types of analytics used to derive insights and make data-driven decisions. Each type serves a different purpose in the process of analyzing data and understanding business performance. The four types of analytics are:

* Descriptive Analytics: This is the most basic form of analytics, focusing on summarizing and describing historical data. Descriptive analytics help answer the question, "What happened?" It involves calculating statistics (e.g., averages, percentages, or counts) and using visualization techniques like charts, graphs, or heatmaps to represent data. This type of analytics helps identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.
* Diagnostic Analytics: Diagnostic analytics goes beyond descriptive analytics by answering the question, "Why did it happen?" This type of analytics involves deeper data exploration, using techniques like data mining, correlation analysis, and anomaly detection to identify the root causes of events, patterns, or trends observed in the data.
* Predictive Analytics: Predictive analytics aims to answer the question, "What is likely to happen in the future?" It uses historical data, statistical models, and machine learning algorithms to forecast future outcomes and trends. Predictive analytics helps organizations make proactive decisions and plan for potential future scenarios. Examples of predictive analytics techniques include linear regression, time series analysis, and decision trees.
* Prescriptive Analytics: Prescriptive analytics seeks to answer the question, "What should we do about it?" It uses optimization techniques, simulation, and advanced algorithms to recommend the best course of action for a given situation. Prescriptive analytics helps organizations make informed decisions, taking into account various constraints, objectives, and trade-offs. Examples of prescriptive analytics techniques include linear programming, genetic algorithms, and reinforcement learning.

These four types of analytics form a continuum, from understanding historical data to making well-informed decisions for the future. Organizations often use a combination of these analytics types to derive valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.

# Data Science Methodology
Data Science Methodology refers to the systematic approach used to solve problems and derive insights from data. The main topics within this methodology include:.
Following are topics encompass the key steps in a typical data science project and provide a structured approach to solving data-driven problems.
* Problem Definition: Identifying the problem or question that needs to be addressed and setting clear objectives.
* Data Collection: Gathering relevant data from various sources, which may include structured or unstructured data, public or private datasets, or real-time data streams.
* Data Preparation: Cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, outlier detection, data type conversion, normalization, or feature engineering.
* Data Exploration: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. This may involve descriptive statistics, data visualization, or hypothesis testing.
* Feature Selection: Choosing the most relevant variables or features for modeling based on their importance, correlation with the target variable, or other criteria.
* Model Selection: Selecting the appropriate machine learning or statistical model based on the problem type, data distribution, and desired outcomes.
* Model Training: Splitting the dataset into training and validation (or test) sets, and fitting the selected model to the training data.
* Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or mean squared error, depending on the problem type (classification, regression, etc.).
* Model Tuning: Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters or architecture to improve performance, using techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.
* Model Deployment: Deploying the trained model to a production environment, where it can be used to make predictions or recommendations based on new data.
* Model Monitoring & Maintenance: Continuously monitoring the performance of the deployed model, updating it with new data, and refining it as needed to maintain its accuracy and relevance.
